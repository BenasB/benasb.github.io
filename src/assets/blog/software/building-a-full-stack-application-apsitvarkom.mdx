## Introduction

"Apsitvarkom" (Eng. "Let's clean up") is a web application that helps people track polluted locations and create cleaning events. This application has no monetary incentive for the users and relies on people doing good deeds with the goal of cleaning the environment around them. Users are presented with a map where they can report new polluted locations or view details (including the cleaning events) about existing ones.

This application was made as a university project.

You can check out the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/vu-vibedosa).
