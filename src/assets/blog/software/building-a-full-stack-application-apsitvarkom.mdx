## Introduction

"Apsitvarkom" (Eng. "Let's clean up") is a web application that helps people track polluted locations and create cleaning events. This application has no monetary incentive for the users and relies on people doing good deeds with the goal of cleaning the environment around them. Users are presented with a map where they can report new polluted locations or view details (including the cleaning events) about existing ones.

This application was made as a university project (thanks to Šarūnas Griškus, Vilius Bakutis and Domas Dragūnas).

You can check out the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/vu-vibedosa).

## Front end

For our front end part of the application, we chose to create a **React SPA** mainly because I already had experience with it prior and since React has a big community, it offers a lot of documentation and material for getting started or when you're eventually stuck.

### Styling

All of the styling on the front end is using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). Main things we looked out for:

- Minimalistic and clean design
  - Icons provided by [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- Custom components (in hindsight, we could've even utilized [headlessui](https://headlessui.com/) to save time by not building some components from scratch)
- Mobile responsiveness
- [Loading animations](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation#pulse) for some components

### Map

The main interactive component is the map which is provided by Google [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview). However we are not communicating with it directly but rather through [@react-google-maps/api](https://github.com/JustFly1984/react-google-maps-api) which makes it more convenient since we're using React. Do note that to use any of the Google Maps functionality, you need to do that through [Google Maps Platform](https://mapsplatform.google.com/) (which is a part of Google Cloud Platform).

### Routing

The front end does have some routing using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), however we needed only two routes:

- `/` – main dashboard with the map and polluted location list.
- `/location/<id>` – a page for each reported polluted location to view its data.

Do note that when serving your React application, the web server has to take into account these different routes and serve the same html file (since this is just a front end routing).

### Internationalization

We also wanted to support multiple languages. This was achieved with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). Using [i18next-parser](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser), we can automatically extract messages to `.json` files from our source code and keep track of the translations more conveniently.

### Validation

In my experience, relying on in built HTML form validation is not that great, so we've built a basic validation system where we can create [custom validation functions](https://github.com/vu-vibedosa/apsitvarkom-fe/blob/staging/src/utils/validationFunctions.ts) and use them in our forms with custom styling.

## Back end

For our back end part of the application, we chose to create a **RESTful API with .NET** since this was required for our project and we also had the most experience with.

### Database

We are using PostgreSQL together with EF Core. EF Core was a requirement for the project but it turned out pretty useful for us in the long run. We are setting up the EF Core model (including validation/constraints) through [fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/#use-fluent-api-to-configure-a-model). In the codebase, we use the [repository pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design#the-repository-pattern) for services which need to interact with the database. This helps to keep two different layers/concerns separated and allows easier testing.

### Data transfer objects

We faced quite a few obstacles when trying to come up with a schema/contract for our API. What we settled on in the end are these [request/response models](https://github.com/vu-vibedosa/apsitvarkom-be/tree/staging/Apsitvarkom.Models/Public) which (most of the time) are used for a single endpoint. For example a when POSTing a new polluted location, we expect a [`PollutedLocationCreateRequest`](https://github.com/vu-vibedosa/apsitvarkom-be/blob/staging/Apsitvarkom.Models/Public/PollutedLocationCreateRequest.cs) and return a [`PollutedLocationResponse`](https://github.com/vu-vibedosa/apsitvarkom-be/blob/staging/Apsitvarkom.Models/Public/PollutedLocationResponse.cs). We do not perform any business logic on these request/response models and instead we firstly map them into/from "business" models (e.g. [`PollutedLocation`](https://github.com/vu-vibedosa/apsitvarkom-be/blob/staging/Apsitvarkom.Models/PollutedLocation.cs)) using [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) (yes, it's pretty contraversial, but it worked out fine for us).

### Validation

Instead of using in built [data annotation validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/models-data/validation-with-the-data-annotation-validators-cs), we chose to go with [FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) as it allows more complex validation rules (following the same mindset we had for front end validation). Of course, we wanted Swagger to reflect those rules as well, so we utilized [MicroElements.Swashbuckle.FluentValidation](https://github.com/micro-elements/MicroElements.Swashbuckle.FluentValidation) to get support for basic validation rules automatically.

### Reverse geocoding

You might have noticed that when reporting a new polluted location you do not need to input a title. This is because for each new polluted location we are querying the Google Maps [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) which allows us to reverse geocode a location (assign a more human readable title from coordinates). It accepts a `language` parameter, so we're also doing this for the same list of languages that we support on the front end.
